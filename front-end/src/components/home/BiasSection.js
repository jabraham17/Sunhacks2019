          Put simply, bias is the inclusion of anything that indicates a
          preference or favor against or for particular topic. If something were
          to be truly unbiased, there would be nothing besides facts and
          observations present in any news article.

          It is very hard if not impossible to exclude bias from anything. The
          news has a purpose to keep us up to date on important affairs
          throughout the world, but oftentimes bias can force things to be seen
          in a skewed light instead of letting people make conclusions of their
          own.

          It is up to everyone to watch for their own and otherâ€™s biases. If
          people look at a variety of news sources for every event, then they
          are more likely to accurately understand a topic. The goal of this
          website is to help you keep track of the biases in other sites as well
          as your own biases from your preferred news sources.
